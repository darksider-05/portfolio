# My Portfolio Page

[go to page](https://darksider-05.github.io/portfolio/)

A personal portfolio page built with **Flutter**, designed to showcase my skills and projects.   
Although Flutter isn’t traditionally the best option for building web apps, it provided a faster path for me compared to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Though this is a portfolio, it **does not** stop there

This project is designed to be more than a static personal website.

- The entire site is driven by a JSON-based configuration file that contains all textual content in a semi-dynamic structure.
- The Flutter architecture makes it easy to swap out visual assets such as images without modifying the core code.
- All assets (including images and file names) are defined in the JSON configuration, allowing full customization and renaming for a personalized experience.

This approach allows the project to function as both a personal portfolio and a customizable template for others.
